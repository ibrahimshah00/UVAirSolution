        <h2>RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL AIR DUCT CLEANING SERVICES IN FLORIDA</h2>
        <p>
          The air ducts in your home or <span className="highlight">commercial building</span> play a crucial role in
          maintaining <span className="highlight">indoor air quality</span> by circulating air throughout the space.
          Over time, however, these ducts can accumulate dust, dirt, pet dander, mold, and other allergens that may pose
          serious health risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contaminated air ducts can lead to respiratory issues and allergies and even exacerbate conditions like asthma,
          as they distribute harmful particles into the air you breathe. Additionally, excessive build-up within the ductwork may
          create a damp environment that fosters the growth of mold and bacteria. This makes it essential to prioritize regular
          professional cleaning, as it helps remove harmful contaminants and supports a healthier indoor environment for all occupants.
        </p>
